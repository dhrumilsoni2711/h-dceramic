              <h2>Going <span style="color: green;">Green</span> is our second nature</h2>
              <p>The pressure on natural resources is increasing day by day. The future of our planet, and the human race itself, is jeopardized. The onus lies on the shoulders of corporate citizens to act responsibly.</p>
              <p>Fulfilling this responsibility, we at Johnson have initiated several measures, both big and small. As a part of our Vision & Mission, we promote energy conservation by reducing the unnecessary use of precious natural resources. Towards this, we increasingly use green fuels like biomass energy and wind energy. We also leverage local resources and keep manufacturing and distribution local to cut down on fuel consumption wasted in transportation.</p>
              <p>Our initiatives in energy conservation have been awarded by the likes of Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL), and the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE), Ministry of Power, Government Of India. But the biggest reward is the thought that we are leaving the planet behind for our children like the way we found it. Pure and green.</p>
